## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r loading libraries}
library(leaflet)
library(tidyverse)
library(DataExplorer)
```

## Reading files and data exploration steps

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r reading files, echo=FALSE}
setwd("/Applications/Ranu_Imp_Skill_docs/Focus/RCoding/leaflet/")
cathedrals <- read.csv(file = "imbibit_cathedrals.csv")
eateries <- read.csv(file = "imbibit_eateries.csv")
pubs <- read.csv(file = "imbibit_pubs.csv")
```

```{r create report, echo=FALSE}

#DataExplorer::create_report(cathedrals)
#DataExplorer::create_report(eateries)
#DataExplorer::create_report(pubs)

```


```{r getting the map, echo=FALSE}

webmap <- leaflet() %>%  #creates object webmap, which is a leaflet object
  addTiles() %>%         #tiles added
  
  addCircleMarkers(lng = cathedrals$Cathedral.Longitude, lat = cathedrals$Cathedral.Latitude, color = "firebrick", weight = 8, label = cathedrals$Cathedral.Full.Title, popup = paste(cathedrals$Cathedral.Website, cathedrals$Cathedral.Postcode)) %>% 
  
  addCircleMarkers(lng = eateries$Eatery.Longitude, lat = eateries$Eatery.Latitude, color = "blue", weight = 8, label = eateries$Eatery.Name, popup = paste(eateries$Eatery.Description, eateries$Eatery.Website)) %>% 

addCircleMarkers(lng = pubs$Pob.Longitude, pubs$Pub.Latitude, color = "green", weight = 8, label = pubs$Pub.Name, popup = paste(pubs$Pub.Description, pubs$Pub.Website))

```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
